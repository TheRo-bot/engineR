# engineR
Java based game engine that's hopefully gonna be dope

To compile this nicely (and exactly how i've done it) you can follow the instructions in the JavaRunner repository :) 

JavaRunner: https://github.com/TheRo-bot/JavaRunner
** CURRENTLY BETA. TO COMPILE:
 - download RUtils https://github.com/TheRo-bot/RUtils
 - compile RUtils entirely (optionally jar it if you know what you're doing)
 - compile engineR with your compiled RUtils code in the PATH (javac -cp <path>) 
 - run the Main class: java dev.ramar.e2.Main
