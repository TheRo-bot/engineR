Java based game engine that's hopefully gonna be dope



THIS SHIT IS MINE (RAMAR/ROBOT). ASK FOR PERMISSION TO USE IT YOU HETHEN.

!! Eventually this project will be a RamaRepo (https://github.com/TheRo-bot/RamaRepo), but in the meantime you've gotta compile my shit manually

# How to compile my shit manually
- download RUtils.main (https://github.com/TheRo-bot/RUtils)
- Copy the following directory structure:
    `~/dev/ramar/utils/...`
    `~/dev/ramar/e2/...`
    `~/bin/`
* im sure you know that i any folder path when i write `~`
- Compile (in `~`): `javac -d ./bin/ ./dev/ramar/e2/Main.java`
- Run (in `~/bin/`): `java dev.ramar.e2.Main`
   ** NOTE: make sure your console has access to a window manager (powershell for windows, you know what you're doing otherwise)

important keys:
 - ` \` to open console  
   ** CONVENTION: "list" will show you all the commands you can enter from that point
   ** ANNOYANCE: console currently points to System.out, so if you end up jarring the build, make sure you run with a console!
