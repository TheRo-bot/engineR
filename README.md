# engineR
Java based game engine that's hopefully gonna be dope

** Current work is dedicated to the demo_combat branch, i'm making a combat demo babyyyyy

!! Eventually this project will be a RamaRepo (https://github.com/TheRo-bot/RamaRepo), but in the meantime you've gotta compile my shit manually

# How to compile my shit manually
- download RUtils.main (https://github.com/TheRo-bot/RUtils)
- Copy the following directory structure:
    `/dev/ramar/utils/...`
    `/dev/ramar/e2/...`
    `/bin/`
- Compile (in `/`): `javac -d /bin/ /dev/ramar/e2/Main.java`
- Run (in `/bin/`): `java dev.ramar.e2.Main`
   ** NOTE: make sure your console has access to a window manager (powershell for windows, you know what you're doing with \*nix systems)

important keys:
 - ` \` to open console  
   ** CONVENTION: "list" will show you all the commands you can enter from that point
   ** ANNOYANCE: console currently points to System.out, so if you end up jarring the build, make sure you run with a console!
