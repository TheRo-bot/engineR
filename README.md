*combat demo baby!!!*

This branch is dedicated to the combat demo of AIRSQUAD, so basically the core mechanics of shooting, dodging, blocking, cover, and enemy shoot shoot through some predefined levels

You wanna compile? check the main for instructions. just use this branch instead of main and it should work fine
